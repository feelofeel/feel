# FEEL — a documentation operating system

**FEEL** is how docs work in a feelofeel project. Git versions code; **FEEL versions docs**. The goal is to *feel light*: quick lookups, few tokens, no soreness from re-reading thousands of lines to find one fact.

It rests on four pillars:

- **F — Frontmatter first.** Every doc opens with a YAML head that declares its identity, role, version, and relations. You learn a doc's place in the system from its first ~12 lines — you never read a body to find out what a doc *is*.
- **E — Explicit, two-way relations.** Authoring relations (`source_of` / `derived_from`) are declared on **both** ends. The doc graph lives in data — checkable by a skill, viewable in Obsidian.
- **E — Evolve with proportional ceremony.** Docs carry `doc_revision` + `app_version` + `updated`, but the process scales with risk: safety work gets full ceremony; light polish does not.
- **L — Light by default.** One super-index (`CLAUDE.md`) routes every task. The **catalog routes; the heads version.** Read the smallest bucket that answers the question.

This file is the operating spec — what you run every session. **Adopting FEEL in a new project, choosing how deep to go, agent bindings, and scaling past the tested envelope live in the companion [feel-adoption](feel-adoption.md).** The seed of the boilerplate: copy both files + the `feel-*` skills + a `CLAUDE.md` skeleton into a new repo and you have FEEL.

## 1. The frontmatter head

Every Markdown doc under `docs/` (and `CLAUDE.md`) starts with a YAML head:

```yaml
---
title: Feature Specs & Acceptance Criteria  # human title (may differ from the H1)
id: feature-specs                           # kebab-case, unique, stable — the machine handle
role: spec                                  # see §2
status: canonical                           # see §2
doc_revision: 7                              # integer, bumped on each meaningful content change
app_version: 1.47.0
updated: 2026-05-30                         # YYYY-MM-DD of last meaningful content change
validated_prod_version: 1.10.0              # optional: prod app version observed during validation
validated_dev_version: 1.10.0               # optional: dev app version observed during validation
validated_at: 2026-05-30                    # optional: date of prod/dev validation
source_of: [user-guide, admin-guide]        # docs authored FROM this one (ids)
derived_from: []                            # docs this one is authored FROM (ids)
---
```

`id` is the stable machine handle. It answers "which doc is this?" Filenames can move (a doc relocating to `conventions/` keeps its `id`); links and relations reference the `id`, so nothing downstream breaks on a move.

**A derived doc** (one authored from another) carries the same fields but inherits `app_version` from its source and declares the back-link: `derived_from: [feature-specs]`, `source_of: []`.

Optional fields, used only when they earn their place:

- `related: [ids]` — non-authoring cross-links worth surfacing in the graph.
- `supersedes` / `superseded_by: <id>` — for replaced docs.
- `tracker: <external-id-or-url>` — convenience back-link to the external work-tracker item driving this doc's changes. **Not** part of the authoring graph: no symmetry, `feel-doc` doesn't validate it, remove it when the work closes. Which tracker a project uses is declared in `feel.config.yaml`, never in this spec.
- `validated_prod_version` / `validated_dev_version` / `validated_at` — evidence a visually or operationally sensitive doc was checked against live environments. For UI, runbook, and environment docs; omit for ordinary conceptual edits.
- `toc: ["§1 Title", …]` — H2-level section index, for docs with 4+ sections. Lets a reader grasp structure from the head alone and issue a targeted section read instead of loading the body. Maintained by `feel-doc`.
- `head_lines: <int>` — line count of the navigational zone (head + any post-YAML summary block), so a reader can `Read(limit=N)`. Only for docs carrying a post-YAML summary; omit otherwise.

---

## 2. Vocabularies

**`role`** — what kind of doc this is. Drives where it sits in the catalog and how heavily it's read.

| role | meaning | examples |
|---|---|---|
| `index` | navigational catalog or router | `index`, `feature-router` |
| `spec` | canonical product / feature specification | `feature-specs`, `developer-stories` |
| `reference` | stable factual reference | `invariants`, `glossary`, `api-reference` |
| `convention` | design / style / process choice | `feel`, `ui-design` |
| `guide` | derived how-to for an end user or operator | `user-guide`, `admin-guide`, `local-dev-setup` |
| `rationale` | design rationale / architecture | `architecture` |
| `log` | append-only historical record | `decisions` |
| `plan` | forward-looking plan; may be superseded by reality | `roadmap` |

**`status`** — the doc's lifecycle state.

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `living` | continuously updated to track reality |
| `canonical` | the authoritative source for its domain |
| `draft` | work in progress, not yet authoritative |
| `plan` | a plan not yet (fully) realized |
| `deprecated` | superseded; kept for history (set `superseded_by`) |

---

## 3. Versioning

Two stamps are required everywhere; a third binds docs to a **version stream** when the repo has one:

- **`doc_revision`** — *what local revision of this doc is this?* An integer, starting at `1`, bumped by `feel-doc` on each substantive edit. It is only an ordering counter inside the doc's own history, not a product reference and not an identity. Cosmetic touches (typos, adding the head) do **not** bump it.
- **`updated`** — *when was it last true?* The date of the last meaningful content change.
- **`app_version`** — *what was the product when this doc was last made true?* The `CHANGELOG.md` app semver current at `updated`. This is the product anchor: it ties a doc to app reality, so you can see at a glance whether a doc predates a feature.

**Version streams.** `app_version` is one binding of a general idea: a doc anchored to the release stream of the thing it describes. Use the binding that matches the repo:

| Repo shape | Stream field | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| Shipping app (this repo) | `app_version` | `CHANGELOG.md` semver |
| Library / package | `lib_version` | package manifest version |
| Monorepo | one stream field per package; a doc carries the stream of the package it describes | each package's manifest |
| Docs-only / no release train | **omit the stream field** | `doc_revision` + `updated` carry versioning alone |

A repo without a release train is a first-class FEEL citizen, not an exception — the stream field is required only where a stream exists (L4, see [feel-adoption](feel-adoption.md) §1). Docs describing FEEL itself carry `feel_version` instead (the version of this spec they conform to).

Optional validation stamps answer a narrower question: *which deployed app versions were observed when this doc was checked?* Use them when the doc's truth depends on seeing prod/dev reality (UX conventions, environment maps, runbooks). Do not encode prod/dev versions in `doc_revision`; one doc edit can be conceptual, pre-release, post-release, or inherited.

**Inheritance.** A derived doc (`derived_from` set) inherits its source's `app_version` — the guides move when the spec moves, not on their own clock. Group docs that share a parent can share a version this way.

---

## 4. Relations

`source_of` / `derived_from` capture the **authoring** relation: *"this doc is written FROM that one."* The guides are written from the feature spec; therefore:

- `feature-specs` → `source_of: [user-guide, admin-guide]`
- `user-guide` → `derived_from: [feature-specs]`
- `admin-guide` → `derived_from: [feature-specs]`

**Symmetry is law.** Every `source_of: [X]` MUST have a matching `derived_from` entry in `X`, and vice-versa. A dangling relation is a bug; `feel-doc` checks symmetry on every run.

**Links vs relations.** Two layers, on purpose:

- **Body links** use GitHub-flavored Markdown — `[the guide](../guides/user-guide.md)` — so the public repo renders correctly.
- **Relations** in frontmatter use `id`s — the machine-readable, move-proof layer that tools and Obsidian resolve.

**Obsidian is an optional lens.** Because relations are frontmatter `id`s, you can open `docs/` as an Obsidian vault for graph view and backlinks at any time. Nothing *depends* on Obsidian — don't put `[[wikilinks]]` in bodies (they don't render on GitHub).

---

## 5. Index-first reading (the light contract)

**The catalog routes; the heads version.**

- **`CLAUDE.md` is the super-index** — always loaded, the one map. It holds a compact **doc catalog** (`id · role · read-when · relations`) and the **change-type router** (changing X? → read these docs / code / tests). One glance routes any task; you should rarely need to open another doc just to find where to look.
- **The heads carry the versions.** When you need a doc's freshness or lineage, read its ~12-line head — not its body, and not a separate registry.
- **`docs/index.md`** is the public entry point for GitHub browsers: the public/local tier split plus a plain link list. It points at the `CLAUDE.md` super-index for routing rather than duplicating it.

Reading order for any change: `CLAUDE.md` (rules + router) → the bucket's docs → the code anchor → the concept test. Read the smallest bucket that matches; widen only if the task crosses a boundary.

The full traversal, as a contract:

```
CLAUDE.md (always loaded)
  └─ change-type router → which doc + code anchor
       └─ doc head → is it current? (app_version) · role? · relations?
            ├─ [derived_from set?] check source's app_version; if source is newer, read source first
            ├─ [source_of set?]   derived docs inherit app_version; feel-doc syncs them downstream
            └─ doc body → only if head confirms this is the right place
                 └─ code anchor → implementation
                      └─ concept test → executable truth
```

**Traversal rules:**
- Source is authority — on conflict, update source first; `feel-doc` syncs derived docs. Read a source/derived pair as source head → relevant source section → derived head, opening the derived body only for role-specific content the source lacks.
- Body links ≠ authoring relations — `[see architecture §4]` is navigation; only `source_of`/`derived_from` is the graph.
- **Staleness rule (standing):** before acting on any doc's content, glance at `app_version`; if it predates the feature you're touching, update body + `/feel-doc` before relying on it.

## 6. Governance — the decision log is skill-only

`docs/history/decisions.md` is an append-only `log`. It is written **only** by the `feel-decision` skill — never by hand. Two operations:

- **append** — when a non-obvious decision is made, add one dated row: `| date | decision | codified in |`. The substance goes in the doc named under *codified in* (`architecture`, `invariants`, …), not in the log.
- **prune-audit** — routinely, verify each row's *codified in* target actually contains the decision now. If it does, the row has done its job: prune it. Git retains the full history. This keeps the live log a short rolling window instead of an ever-growing wall.

A decision "graduates" out of the log once it's incorporated elsewhere. The log is a staging area, not an archive — the archive is git.

**Division of labour.** The human owns intent, scope, approval of risky actions, and prune-audit judgment (only rows the human explicitly confirms get pruned — absorption is validated by a human read, not a file-existence check). The AI owns routing, execution, skill invocation per ceremony level, and doc-head maintenance — the human never manually bumps `doc_revision`/`app_version` or hunts for the authoritative file.

### Authoring with AI assistance

Three rules whenever a human edits a FEEL-managed doc directly (editor, chat UI, or paste):

1. **Match the doc type before writing.** Every CLAUDE.md section should answer: *invariant (must be true every session) or tactic (how to execute one kind of task)?* Invariants — hard rules, guardrails, always-true workflow steps — belong in the super-index. Tactics — execution style, "this time do X", plan-mode behaviour — belong in a decision-log entry, a guide, or said in-session. A tactic in CLAUDE.md adds permanent token cost with session-bounded value.

2. **Manual edits need `/feel-doc` to close.** Edit freely; the skill is the hygiene step, not the authoring step. After any free-form addition, run `/feel-doc` to resync `doc_revision`, `updated`, and relations. A doc edited without closing the loop has a stale head and may lose relation symmetry.

3. **Project adaptations live in CLAUDE.md fences, not in the spec.** Changes to `feel.md` propagate to every future FEEL adoption (`feel_version` tracks which spec revision a copy derives from). Project-specific rules — custom ceremony levels, domain guardrails, skill triggers — belong in `CLAUDE.md` behind `<!-- project rules -->` fences or `feel.config.yaml` PROJECT DATA. To evolve the spec itself, do it intentionally: bump `feel_version` and treat it as a FEEL release.

---

## 7. Ceremony levels

FEEL is not a tax. Pick the smallest ceremony that protects the risk:

| Level | Use for | Required behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **Safety** | Poster writes, migrations, prod operations, auth, tenancy | Full guardrails: read the governing docs, use the named project skill, update load-bearing docs, record non-obvious decisions, and verify before prod impact. |
| **Normal** | Feature behaviour, user-visible flows, docs, changelog-worthy operator workflow | Sync the relevant spec/docs, add an Unreleased changelog note when behaviour changed, and run focused tests/checks. |
| **Light** | Copy, CSS, visual polish, internal refactors | Inspect nearby context, test only what risk justifies, and skip changelog/version/doc-head churn unless behaviour changed. |
| **Emergency / skip** | Explicit owner request: "skip ceremony", "no ceremony", "skip the skills", "quick one" | Do the work with no routine changelog/doc overhead. Safety ceremony still applies if safety areas are touched; log only safety-relevant actions. |

If a task mixes levels, follow the highest-risk level for the risky part and keep the rest light. The decision log is for choices that constrain future work, not for every implementation detail.

**Version bookkeeping is release-cut only.** While a stream is in flight, it adds `[Unreleased]` bullets and bumps `doc_revision` + `updated` on docs it actually changes. It never bumps `package.json` versions or sweeps `app_version` globally — that is the release cut's job, once, on the integration branch, via `<project>-release`.

---

## 8. The skill family

FEEL ships as skills (`.claude/commands/`). The naming line is the reusability boundary:

- **`feel-*` — framework-generic, portable to any project.** The active core is five skills:
  - `feel-doc` — create or update a doc to the FEEL standard: write/refresh the head, bump `doc_revision`, stamp `app_version` + `updated`, enforce relation symmetry, refresh the `CLAUDE.md` catalog.
  - `feel-decision` — the sole writer of `decisions.md` (append + prune-audit, §6).
  - `feel-repeat` — doc **and skill** network health check: detects cross-doc staleness, missing relation declarations, within-doc concept duplication, docs that have grown past the head-count thresholds defined in `docs/feel.config.yaml`, and skill-layer drift (active/archived duplicates, dangling references, missing contracts, `feel-*` portability leaks, orphans). Run after any doc edit (`--diff`) or periodically as a full-graph scan.
  - `feel-session` — session-opening brief: git state, open changelog work, and the planning pointer into a ≤20-line orient. Session start, not frequent.
  - `feel-health` — the **success gauge**: doc/skill token-footprint dashboard over `tools/feel/health.mjs`. With `feel-repeat` it answers "is FEEL set up right and still light?" — `feel-repeat` audits structural honesty (relations, staleness, duplication — across docs *and* the skill family), `feel-health` audits weight. A green pass on both is the objective "yes."
- **`<project>-*` — project-specific, stay with the project:** e.g. `<project>-changelog`, `<project>-migration` (versioning, schema changes, API integration).

**The extended set is archived, not deleted.** Eight further `feel-*` skills (`feel-ghost`, `feel-trace`, `feel-shrink`, `feel-contract`, `feel-mistake`, `feel-sibling`, `feel-seed`, `feel-diff`) live in `feel/skills/` — copy one back into `.claude/commands/` to reactivate. Useful at scale, but each adds per-session skill-text cost, so they stay out of the active set until a project earns them.

**Contracts.** Skills carrying a `## Contract` section (`requires / guarantees / never`) are chainable and auditable — the `never` clauses constrain an AI that might otherwise hallucinate an action. New skills should always include one. Skill shape: YAML `description` (triggers) → a first visible line stating what the skill does → numbered steps → `## Argument`. The first line matters in the Claude Code UI.

**The skill family is subject to the same honesty audits as docs.** Skills accrete and drift exactly like documentation — stale duplicates linger after a rename, references dangle when a skill is archived, contracts go missing, and a portable `feel-*` skill picks up a host-project term. `feel-repeat` therefore scans the skill directories (active + archived) alongside the doc graph; a clean skill layer is part of "FEEL is set up right," not a separate concern.

---

## 9. Scope — what FEEL heads are *for*

FEEL heads solve one specific problem: **the described thing can drift from the describing thing.** A doc describes a feature; the feature changes; the doc doesn't know. `app_version` bridges that gap. `source_of`/`derived_from` make the authoring graph explicit because it isn't structurally enforced anywhere else.

This condition is **absent for code files:**

- A code file IS the current state — it cannot be stale relative to itself.
- The import graph already IS the relationship graph, runtime-enforced (a comment that can drift vs. a module system that fails loudly).
- Git provides authorship, date, and line-level diff — more granular than any header field.

**The heuristic:** apply FEEL heads wherever described and describer can drift independently. Don't apply them where structural enforcement already guarantees consistency.

For code→doc traceability, prefer a central router (CLAUDE.md's change-type table) over per-file concept tags. One router update reaches every file in a module; distributed headers contradict each other silently and give no reverse direction.

## 10. Quick-reference card

```
Starting a change?           → CLAUDE.md change-type router first
Reading a derived doc?       → compare its app_version to source's; if source newer, read source first
Choose ceremony level        → safety / normal / light / emergency-skip (§7)
Editing a source doc?        → feel-doc only for meaningful action-changing edits
Doc looks stale?             → update body + /feel-doc before relying on it
Behaviour changed?           → /<project>-changelog Unreleased note
Non-obvious decision?        → /feel-decision (never hand-edit decisions.md)
Schema change?               → /<project>-migration (files first, then apply)
Solo work?                   → commit directly to main (PR for sweeping changes)
≥2 parallel streams?         → node tools/worktree.mjs new <slug> (ws/<slug> worktree each)
Finishing a stream?          → node tools/worktree.mjs done <slug>
Ready to release?            → /<project>-release (version bump + doc sweep + CHANGELOG cut)
Too many permission prompts? → /fewer-permission-prompts
```

If Claude misses a skill, tune the trigger phrases in that skill's `description:` frontmatter — the cheapest fix before reaching for settings.json hooks.
